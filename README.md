# Web scrap FIFA data

Ths data base include 2 tables one for players from this web site - https://sofifa.com/players
And one for teams from here https://sofifa.com/teams.


If you want to insert this data to a Postgres SQL database you need to config an egine in line 5 at main.py.



I plan to later add textual information from leading sports sites from around the world regarding players and teams and thus try to develop NLP models to predict the value of the player or team to which it is most appropriate.
